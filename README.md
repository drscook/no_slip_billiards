# Billiard Dynamics

Implements billiard dynamics of many spherical particles in arbitrary dimension with standard and non-standard particle-wall and particle-particle collision maps using either standard CPU serial mode or accelerated parallel mode using NVIDIA GPU with numba cuda.

Currently supports the standard specular collision and the no-slip collision law.
